# Widget Space

Check out the custom widgets that'll be used across my website. So far there's a modal pop-up  and accordian drop-down. An image/content carousel and drag-and-drop area are a few others I plan to add in the future.

## PHP Includes

In the [widgetSpace.php file](https://github.com/dvereen1/WidgetSpace/blob/main/widgetSpace.php), you'll notice some includes.

`<?php include_once("headNoNav.php");?>`

`<?php include_once("Classes/projectInfoModal.php");
       createProjectModal("Widget Space", $projectModalArr);
?>`
